# Juanma Orta - Resume. AngularJS boostrap format
Welcome to the source code of my interactive resume.
This resume is also a proof of concept of some front-end development skills: **HTML5**, **Javascript**, **CSS**, (and CoffeeScript/SASS as well), **AngularJS** and **responsive layout**.

## Installation:
To make this resume fully interactive, you need to fulfill an easy installation process.
You need to have [http://nodejs.org](Node.js), [http://bower.io](Bower) and [http://gruntjs.com](Grunt) installed in your computer. 

After you have cloned the repo, you must update the node packages needed:
```
npm install
```

Then download the JS dependencies by typing:
```
bower install
```

Then, to build the app type:
```
grunt build
```

You'll find the interactive app at dist/index.html

## Local server mode
You can also run the CV as a local server, using Node http server features. Just run:
```
grunt serve
```
